1) Should this operator be a member or nonmember?
    - Non-member, so we do not need to modify the original string.

2) Should it be applicable to constant strings?
    - The string is constant, so it doesnâ€™t get changed.

3) Where might such an operator come in handy? (Maybe on a previous lab?)
    - With operators overloadings.
