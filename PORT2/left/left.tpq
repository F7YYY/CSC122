1) How can you easily determine the widest that the columns need to be?
(Hint: See this page about calculating the number of digits in a whole number.)
    - The easiest way to determine the width is to use setw() functions.

2) Once you know the width of a column, how can you determine whether a table
will fit on the screen?
    - We can determine weather a table will fit on the sccreen or not by just
    working the way through and debugging the code.

3) How can you get the columns to line up so nice and neat?
    - Again, we can just use the function setw();

4) How can you get your menu to accept both character and numeric input like
that? (Hint: You donâ€™t need to resort to peek here!)
    - In the if else function the paremeters always need to accept numberic
    and chars.

5) Do you need any flags to get your columns to line up neatly?
    - No we dont need any flags.
